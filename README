CHEAT SHEETS AND OTHER INTERESTING DOCUMENTS
============================================

I recently figured that I spend way too much time on the net searching for the same things over and over again. Blogs make good tools for noting down information about big tasks, but usually it's the tiny odd-job that you are looking to get done, or that one special or obscure command that you _just can't remember_. I intend to note such things down in this repo.

NOTE:
These are commands that I have used myself. I don't claim that the information here is completely accurate or that the commands are the best tools for the job at hand.
